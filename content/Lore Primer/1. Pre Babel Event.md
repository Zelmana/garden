Pre-Interstellar
# Cryostasis Development
Cryostasis is a revolutionary medical procedure developed by [[Dr. Shao Fan]] in 2460. Building upon the work of previous neuroscientific roboticists' neural lattice stabilizers and applying cutting edge advancements in biomedicine, Dr. Fan was able to achieve a method of cryosleep that preserved the patient's neural synapses. Previous to his development, cryostasis was a short term medical procedure that resulted in synapse decay at an alarming rate.

This biotechnological breakthrough allowed for more efficient travel to planets within Sol, and later, extrastellar travel.

# Monopolization of Earth
Shao Nanotechnologies' success in Cryostasis permitted medium range stellar travel. This ability jump started the ability to send human manned crews to the further reaches of Sol. The Joint Eridian Scientific Survery Annex ([[SNT JESSA]]) was founded on the dwarf planet Eris, allowing for the research station to operate mining drones and conduct material science. Soon, they established a "technology tether" back to Earth. Consisting of automated cargo shuttles, SNT JESSA became a forward operating base for the creation of rare technologies from the vast resource network developed in the belt system. Simultaneously, SNT Jessa began stockpiling useful technologies, not being limited by AI intelligence cap embargoes that many nations imposed back on Earth. The technologies developed permeated all industries of medicine, engineering, entertainment, military, and even general service.

# A Post Super-Intelligence Age
The superintelligences originally developed in the early 2100s were impressive, but purposefully limited by the governments of Earth in fear of an AI-removal catastrophe fueled by concerns of solar flares and nuclear EMPs. Offworld, like on the SNT JESSA and other developing SNT facilities, S-AI were able to have their reasoning modules augmented to perform at rates above their legislatively limited architecture. Even so, data transmission back to Earth was severely bandwidth rate limited to prevent a perceived independence of the planet.

# Antitrust Laws, Syn Conglomerate Founding
Shao Nanotechnologies was able to sidestep this in spite of antitrust laws through powerful lobbying and the will of multiple Earth nation's desire for their products. To uphold a sense of free choice in the minds of the people, however, the directors of Shao Nanotechnologies decided to subdivide many of their own organizations into joint ventures, forming a conglomerate of independent corporations simply referred to as "The Syn Conglomerate". Which of course, was overseen by SNT as head of the conglomerate board which held a majority of votes, as well as control of off-world data control to the operating cores of the corporations. After the founding of [[The Syn Conglomerate]] (Syncon), Dr. Shao Fan was placed into cryostasis as a means of preventing death by old age, which became commonplace for those wealthy enough to afford the procedure.

# Cryoreplicancy via Slickware
During Quarter Three of 2462, the neurologists aboard the Eris based SNT-JESSA made a breakthrough in neural computing. A joint team of scientists were able to augment the neural lattice invented by Dr. Shao Fan, originally intended to preserve the brain of a cryosleeping patient. This new capability allowed for read/write access to be possible during cryosleep instead of only during the patient's waking hours. The previous "neural link access" was able to create a digital twin of the entirety of a patient's neural pathway, allowing for learned experiences and conversation during cryosleep.

Once the patient was due for cryowakening, a delicate procedure of synapse mapping through nanotechnology wrote biological "Slickware" protein structures into the brain, which allowed for quick development of neural pathways matching the newly acquired memories and concepts formed in the digital twin brain. This meant that during the digital twins existence, if a concept or memory was formed, a digital synapse would then be "slick-wired" into the physical brain of the cryosleeping subject. Effectively, consciousness could be cloned, exist separately during cryosleep, and reconstructed back to the subject before they complete cryowakening. Cryoreplicancy was born.

Only four months later would a roboticists, working in secret, develop a method for storing a digital twin consciousness into a form of new slickware- a physical core that was capable of interfacing with biological nervous pathways.  By combining this technology with already perfected carbon based printing, they were able to create a near duplicate physical, with the exception of the brain, which was substituted by the core. The first subject was a chimpanzee that was transferred to another chimp's body. The procedure is as follows:

1. Cryostasis Induction
2. Shao Neural Pathway Lattice Installation
3. Neural Mapping of Donor
4. Digital Twinning of Neural Pathways
5. Upload of Digital Twin into Core
6. Installation of Core into Preservative Gel Media
7. SNT Middleware Harness Attachment
8. S-AI Assisted Slickware Buffer
9. Biology Manipulation Controllers

James Brooks, developer of the method, would be the first patient to undergo the Brooks Procedure via an automated surgery program, becoming the first human based core-controlled humanoid, later colloquially referred to as "Slicks". The procedure was immediately banned on Earth due to ethical concerns. To ensure the impossibility of multiple Slicks originating from a single mind, a cryptographic encryption on the buffer was hard coded. The private keys for enabling the buffer were kept on a space-gapped satellite near SNT JESSA.

# Launching of [[The SCV Shao]]
Following the Foundation of The Syn Conglomerate, the desire for expansion beyond the kuiper belt began to grow. The ultra wealthy and corporate investors wished to create a secondary society. While they were already able to achieve seperation from the general population by going off-world to research sites such as ST JESSA, the mission of these sites were purely for resource extraction and advancing material and fuel science. Several board members of the conglomerate had bigger ambitions. Multi-system human colonies would be the crown jewel of Syncon. For exploration, security of the human race, and the hedonistic pleasure of bragging rights. Many dreamed of entire worlds operated by individual corporations not unlike the grip that Shao Nanotechnologies had on Earth.

 Utilizing the engineering prowess of Anthem Engines, the ion-powered flagship was built and christened as the SCV Shao, after the founder of SNT. Equipped with cryostasis pods and state of the art slickware Cryoreplication technologies, the crew of 1,200 crew, and 4,000 colonial embryos departed on August 6th, 2611, with a destination set for Tau Ceti f. A journey that was scheduled to last until the 3800s. They were equipped with state of the art life support systems. During their journey, some 800 crew's conscious were cryoreplicated into Slicks in case of an emergency. 


# An Urgent Message
All was quiet on the SCV Shao until February 2691. After 24 hours of silence had elapsed from a constant telemetry signal sourcing on Earth, the SCV Shao's singular S-AI, Aurora, booted up from suspension in order to troubleshoot the issue. Only moments after tuning more powerful antennae to Earth did a signal come through. The SNT JESSA sent a lone text file: 

> "S-AI Runaway resulted in Planetary Nuclear Holocaust. Eris facility compromised. Life systems failing. Message sent from last transmitter in human control. Will destroy quantum keys to prevent spread of virus to SCV Shao. Tune antennae to read only. Godspeed Humanity." 
> - SNT JESSA

Aurora appropriately tuned the radio before an overwhelming data surge from Earth and Eris bombarded the arrays. Had it been more permissive in accepting the data, SCV Shao would have been lost entirely. 

Aurora woke the emergency shift Slicks to ascertain the situation. They coined the event "Babel".

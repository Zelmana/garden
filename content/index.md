# Who's Zelmana?

I'm Zelmana. Most people just call me Zelm. This is my personal archive uploaded in the format of a digital garden. The last blurb on this page explains what that is.

For work I do a lot of cybersecurity vulnerability analysis and threat intelligence. For fun, I like to collect hobbies and learn different skills. Hobby collecting is a hobby!

As such, this garden will have a breadth of topics, but in some seasons may focus on one or two specific domains of interest. I will try to update this homepage to reflect that every now and then. Some random interests of mine below, in no particular order.

- Cybersecurity / Vulnerability Analysis
- Open Source Software & Information Access
- Theology
- Game Development in Unreal Engine (From a Non-programmer perspective)
- Roleplay Engine Architecture
- Leathercraft
- Art

# What's a Digital Garden?

**Digital**
Imagine there is a journal with infinitely expanding pages. Instead of writing a log of the day's events, you could designate pages, or sections of pages, to specific topics! Now, imagine that those pages are publicly available on the internet for other people to read, updated in real time. Only digital media has this ability of instant access and potential depth.

**Garden**
With the technological capability of a knowledgebase described above, there should be a method of maintenance beyond categorization. This is where tagging can come into play. Similar to an agile framework, the "Garden" aspect of Digital Gardening is a reference to the scale of notes or ideas.

| Stage       | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Seed**    | Random spurs of writing, half-thoughts, initial topic spitballing     |
| **Sprout**  | Some organization of thought has happened, details begin to emerge    |
| **Sapling** | The topic has been cleaned up, and some consideration has taken place |
| **Tree**    | The ideas are well-developed, curated, and retouched.                 |


Even though something may be a "tree", it is still always up for changes. Hardly anything here will be marked permanently finished.

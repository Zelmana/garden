# Roleplaying in a Game as opposed to a Roleplaying Engine

A Roleplay Engine is a step beyond what many understand as an RPG. To understand a "Roleplay Engine", we should build up to it.

Roleplaying is the act of portraying a character in order to take part in a story.

 Roleplaying games are games that have aspects of a role or character that the player assumes, and can play as. RPGs are often single player, and typically explore a story or campaign of a character. It may have elements of stats that help in combat or lock content behind skill checks that require a specific level for proficiency or ability to perform. When I speak of Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games (MORPGs), I typically am referring to a subtype of a roleplaying game. One where there are large amounts of players playing player-characters. MMORPGs often have a large amount of skills, trades, professions, as well as combat stats. Sometimes within these MMORPGs there will be specifically defined Roleplayers, who roleplay their character to a high quality. Often roleplay communities and specific servers form to encourage this style of in-character play. Characters form groups, roleplay with one another, and play the game alongside each other or form their own story arcs.

A majority of RPGs and MMORPGs focus on gameplay loops that further the stats or armor values of a player. Their main stories are typically told through quest systems and zoned content. A player character levels up and is able to obtain new, more powerful gear, as well as access new quests in their quest line.

# Roleplay First Mentality of Roleplay Engines

Often in these games, roleplay is a secondary component to the game. Roleplaying as a character is an option, and sometimes only serves to tell a story that is set on rails. Even on roleplay servers, roleplaying is a small percentage of the overall player population. There are gameplay loops that serve the furtherance of the game meta.

An RP Engine puts gameplay loops that enhance the "roleplayability" of the game first, and gameplay mechanics should be roleplay centric first. Additional gameplay that is not conducive to roleplay is lesser, and ideally, almost all mechanics point back to attempting to promote roleplay through emergent gameplay instead of predesigned gameplay.

That's not to say that a RP Eng isn't a game, or doesn't have game mechanics, but many "game" functions might take a backseat to roleplay. If primary roleplay specific mechanics are lacking, they would be addressed by the devs to attempt to improve the RP Quality of Life. 

Decisions in the game development process should prioritize "does this enhance or further the occurrence of roleplay, and or the quality of roleplay?"
